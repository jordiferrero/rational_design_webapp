# Project requirements

This should be a webapp (not a website) tool that converts all the maths, simulations and plots of this academic paper into a webapp that is interactive and allows the user to play with the maths and equations.

Ultimately, the user is intrested in:

1. The fabric design it uses (e.g. yarn material, yarn size, weaving pattern types...)
2. The finishing/coating/texturing material on top (the type of nanoparticles used, the size of the nanoparticles and their spacing, the coating material used e.g. PDMS or CH3...)
3. The liquid to repel (hexadecane, sweat...)

It is important to describe clearly what each parameter is for the user from an application point of view. The GOAL is to translate this theory paper into something practical for us when we are designing a fabric and a finishing technology.

## Content

1. Main page
   the main mage should be a page that is like a TLDR, that just has the application/applied goal of this paper without the nitty grity. Just what the user would pracmatically use in industry to make decisions. The user is a technical textile designer making decisions about their fabric and mateirals to use and coat...

2. Interactive plots for the paper
   I want all equations to have interactivity. Have all the plots in Figure 1,2 and 3 only.
   Be as detailed as possible for most pages. Also include the theory, writen step by step and concept by concept, like a course/tutorial.

## Code

Note currently all the code lives in `python_code` notebook. Convert it to js.

## Framework

Use a simple framework good for webapps for 2025. Keep it simple.
